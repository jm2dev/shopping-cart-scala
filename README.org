* Overview

You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.

** Step 1

Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05

Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input.

** Step 2

The shop decides to introduce two new offers

- buy one, get one free on Apples
- 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

Update your checkout functions accordingly
